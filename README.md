# Calculator
The HTML code defines a simple layout for the calculator, with an input field for the result and buttons for the calculator's functions. The CSS code styles the calculator's elements.

The JavaScript code defines three functions: `addToExpression()`, `clearResult()`, and `calculate()`. The `addToExpression()` function is called when a button is clicked, and it adds the clicked button's value to the calculator's expression. The `clearResult()` function clears the calculator's expression and result. The `calculate()` function evaluates the expression using the `eval()` function, and displays the result in the input field. If an error occurs during evaluation, the function displays "Error" in the input field.
